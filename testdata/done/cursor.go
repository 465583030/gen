/**
 * \brief Determine the set of methods that are overridden by the given
 * method.
 *
 * In both Objective-C and C++, a method (aka virtual member function,
 * in C++) can override a virtual method in a base class. For
 * Objective-C, a method is said to override any method in the class's
 * interface (if we're coming from an implementation), its protocols,
 * or its categories, that has the same selector and is of the same
 * kind (class or instance). If no such method exists, the search
 * continues to the class's superclass, its protocols, and its
 * categories, and so on.
 *
 * For C++, a virtual member function overrides any virtual member
 * function with the same signature that occurs in its base
 * classes. With multiple inheritance, a virtual member function can
 * override several virtual member functions coming from different
 * base classes.
 *
 * In all cases, this function determines the immediate overridden
 * method, rather than all of the overridden methods. For example, if
 * a method is originally declared in a class A, then overridden in B
 * (which in inherits from A) and also in C (which inherited from B),
 * then the only overridden method returned from this function when
 * invoked on C's method will be B's method. The client may then
 * invoke this function again, given the previously-found overridden
 * methods, to map out the complete method-override set.
 *
 * \param cursor A cursor representing an Objective-C or C++
 * method. This routine will compute the set of methods that this
 * method overrides.
 *
 * \param overridden A pointer whose pointee will be replaced with a
 * pointer to an array of cursors, representing the set of overridden
 * methods. If there are no overridden methods, the pointee will be
 * set to NULL. The pointee must be freed via a call to
 * \c clang_disposeOverriddenCursors().
 *
 * \param num_overridden A pointer to the number of overridden
 * functions, will be set to the number of overridden functions in the
 * array pointed to by \p overridden.
