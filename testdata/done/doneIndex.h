/**
 * \brief Determine the set of methods that are overridden by the given
 * method.
 *
 * In both Objective-C and C++, a method (aka virtual member function,
 * in C++) can override a virtual method in a base class. For
 * Objective-C, a method is said to override any method in the class's
 * base class, its protocols, or its categories' protocols, that has the same
 * selector and is of the same kind (class or instance).
 * If no such method exists, the search continues to the class's superclass,
 * its protocols, and its categories, and so on. A method from an Objective-C
 * implementation is considered to override the same methods as its
 * corresponding method in the interface.
 *
 * For C++, a virtual member function overrides any virtual member
 * function with the same signature that occurs in its base
 * classes. With multiple inheritance, a virtual member function can
 * override several virtual member functions coming from different
 * base classes.
 *
 * In all cases, this function determines the immediate overridden
 * method, rather than all of the overridden methods. For example, if
 * a method is originally declared in a class A, then overridden in B
 * (which in inherits from A) and also in C (which inherited from B),
 * then the only overridden method returned from this function when
 * invoked on C's method will be B's method. The client may then
 * invoke this function again, given the previously-found overridden
 * methods, to map out the complete method-override set.
 *
 * \param cursor A cursor representing an Objective-C or C++
 * method. This routine will compute the set of methods that this
 * method overrides.
 *
 * \param overridden A pointer whose pointee will be replaced with a
 * pointer to an array of cursors, representing the set of overridden
 * methods. If there are no overridden methods, the pointee will be
 * set to NULL. The pointee must be freed via a call to
 * \c clang_disposeOverriddenCursors().
 *
 * \param num_overridden A pointer to the number of overridden
 * functions, will be set to the number of overridden functions in the
 * array pointed to by \p overridden.

/**
 * \brief Perform code completion at a given location in a translation unit.
 *
 * This function performs code completion at a particular file, line, and
 * column within source code, providing results that suggest potential
 * code snippets based on the context of the completion. The basic model
 * for code completion is that Clang will parse a complete source file,
 * performing syntax checking up to the location where code-completion has
 * been requested. At that point, a special code-completion token is passed
 * to the parser, which recognizes this token and determines, based on the
 * current location in the C/Objective-C/C++ grammar and the state of
 * semantic analysis, what completions to provide. These completions are
 * returned via a new \c CXCodeCompleteResults structure.
 *
 * Code completion itself is meant to be triggered by the client when the
 * user types punctuation characters or whitespace, at which point the
 * code-completion location will coincide with the cursor. For example, if \c p
 * is a pointer, code-completion might be triggered after the "-" and then
 * after the ">" in \c p->. When the code-completion location is afer the ">",
 * the completion results will provide, e.g., the members of the struct that
 * "p" points to. The client is responsible for placing the cursor at the
 * beginning of the token currently being typed, then filtering the results
 * based on the contents of the token. For example, when code-completing for
 * the expression \c p->get, the client should provide the location just after
 * the ">" (e.g., pointing at the "g") to this code-completion hook. Then, the
 * client can filter the results based on the current token text ("get"), only
 * showing those results that start with "get". The intent of this interface
 * is to separate the relatively high-latency acquisition of code-completion
 * results from the filtering of results on a per-character basis, which must
 * have a lower latency.
 *
 * \param TU The translation unit in which code-completion should
 * occur. The source files for this translation unit need not be
 * completely up-to-date (and the contents of those source files may
 * be overridden via \p unsaved_files). Cursors referring into the
 * translation unit may be invalidated by this invocation.
 *
 * \param complete_filename The name of the source file where code
 * completion should be performed. This filename may be any file
 * included in the translation unit.
 *
 * \param complete_line The line at which code-completion should occur.
 *
 * \param complete_column The column at which code-completion should occur.
 * Note that the column should point just after the syntactic construct that
 * initiated code completion, and not in the middle of a lexical token.
 *
 * \param unsaved_files the Tiles that have not yet been saved to disk
 * but may be required for parsing or code completion, including the
 * contents of those files.  The contents and name of these files (as
 * specified by CXUnsavedFile) are copied when necessary, so the
 * client only needs to guarantee their validity until the call to
 * this function returns.
 *
 * \param num_unsaved_files The number of unsaved file entries in \p
 * unsaved_files.
 *
 * \param options Extra options that control the behavior of code
 * completion, expressed as a bitwise OR of the enumerators of the
 * CXCodeComplete_Flags enumeration. The
 * \c clang_defaultCodeCompleteOptions() function returns a default set
 * of code-completion options.
